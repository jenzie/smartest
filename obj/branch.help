This file loads a large, near over-flowed value into the A (first) register.

It then loops, checking to see if the A register is zero.  If not, it will
increment the register until it overflows, and becomes zero.

Once zero, the program terminates.

Judicious use of NOPs is to compensate for the lack of forwarding,
and lack of complete testing.
