1.	The X/M_B register was renamed to X/M_A, and the D/X_A register now connects
 to X/M_A instead of the X/M_B register, when passing down to the next pipeline
 stage.

1.	In the “Register Transfer Language” section, subtraction (SUB) was added and
 set-less-than (SLT) was removed. SLT was removed as it was unnecessary without
 a branch-less-than (BLT) instruction.  It added up to five more cycles since
 the Smartest pipeline does not support forwarding.
1.	The "Registers" section was removed, as there are no physical registers
 used by the Branch Prediction Table.  The control unit has all values stored
 "within" itself in the code, in the form of arrays and control flag variables.
 
2.	The “Operation” section and all sub-sections were dramatically simplified to
 reflect the simplifications to the branch prediction control logic. Since the
 majority of the physical hardware was removed and moved into the code, only the
 high-level algorithm for the branch prediction is documented.

2.	In the “List of Instructions” section, subtraction (SUB) was added and
 set-less-than (SLT) was removed. SLT was removed as it was unnecessary without
 a branch-less-than (BLT) instruction.  It added up to five more cycles since
 our pipeline does not support forwarding.
 
3.	The "Areas for Improvement" section was removed, as all the changes were
 implemented.
4.	The format for R-type instructions was modified so that the RS register is
 first, the RT is second, and the RD is third.  The change was to allow easier
 processing of selected registers.
